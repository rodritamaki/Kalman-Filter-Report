This repository contains the three scripts used for evaluating the performance of the standard Kalman Filter for the course "Ah Hoc and Sensor Networks" (Master of Engineering of Keio University). The evaluated parameters are the noise covariance of the measurements (R), the noise covariance of the process (Q) and the initial estimate of the error covariance (P).
The delivered report is also included.
